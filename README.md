## My process

This is my third junior challenge from Frontend Mentor and this is the one I am mostly proud of. I used much more max-width and width so when I was writting media queries I didn't have so much to do. I only added width and some paddings to the items so in my opinion the design and this solution are pretty similar.
Keep working and doing all junior challenges.
